- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Fercan

- ðŸ‘€ I am a recent graduate from Le Wagon's Full-Time Data Science Coding Bootcamp. I got into programming last summer with the additional time I have and fell in love with it. I find it very intellectually stimulating and challenging and the problem-solving aspect is what draws me in. I'd describe myself as organized, motivated, and adaptable, with a diverse mental skill set. I'm open to new opportunities and looking to utilise my previous experiences going forward in a new role as a data analyst.
